# Project Type: Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning for Health Risk Identification

Business Strategy and Analysis

Business Strategy: By understanding key factors affecting heart disease risk, healthcare professionals can better identify high-risk individuals and apply preventive measures earlier. This insight can improve patient outcomes and optimize resource allocation in healthcare.

Variables:

Age: The age of patients, which provides insight into the age distribution of the population studied.
Gender: The gender of patients, which may reveal any gender-based risk differences.
Cholesterol Levels: Levels of cholesterol, which is a key indicator of heart disease risk.
Blood Pressure: Resting blood pressure levels, which help assess cardiovascular health.
Target: Binary variable indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Statistics of Key Variables:

Age: The average age is around 54 years, indicating a predominantly middle-aged population, a critical age for heart disease.
Blood Pressure: The mean resting blood pressure is approximately 131 mm Hg, slightly above normal, suggesting potential hypertension in many individuals.
Correlation Matrix: Strong correlations were found between maximum heart rate (thalach) and ST depression (oldpeak) with the target variable.
Observations:

Positive Correlation: Cholesterol levels and age are positively correlated, as cholesterol tends to increase with age.
Negative Correlation: Maximum heart rate and age are negatively correlated, indicating that older individuals generally have lower maximum heart rates.
Visualization:

Age Distribution:
Histogram: Most patients are between 40 and 65 years old, a higher-risk age group for heart disease.
Blood Pressure (trestbps) - Boxplot:
Boxplot: Reveals several outliers in blood pressure data, indicating patients with severe blood pressure issues.
Scatterplot: Age vs. Maximum Heart Rate:
Scatterplot: Shows a clear trend where older individuals tend to have lower maximum heart rates. Blue points represent individuals without heart disease, while red points indicate those with heart disease.
Data Reduction: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):
Purpose: Used to identify underlying patterns in the data.
Components: The first component explains approximately 28% of the variation, and the second component explains about 22%.
SVD Visualization:
SVD Plot: Shows clear clusters based on the presence of heart disease, indicating that selected variables effectively distinguish between individuals with and without heart disease.
Summary and Conclusions:

Key Insights:

Age and Maximum Heart Rate: Strongly associated with heart disease. Older individuals with lower maximum heart rates are more likely to have heart disease.
Blood Pressure and Cholesterol: High levels of these variables are associated with increased risk.
PCA Effectiveness: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) effectively reduces data complexity while preserving significant underlying information, useful for classification and diagnosis.
Implications:

Healthcare Improvement: Insights can aid in early identification of high-risk patients and application of preventive measures.
Future Research: Further analysis of additional variables and application of these insights in machine learning models for heart disease prediction.
